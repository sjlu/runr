# Runr, a Facebook Summer of Hack 2012 application.

Runr is a simple errand planner.  You enter in what you need to do and we find
an efficient way for you to do those things.

We do a Yahoo Local search for places matching your query.  Then, we try to find
the shortest path which goes through at least one place to match each item in
your list.
